# Sakata Mountain

Originally created for Touhou Game Jam 2, using PixiJS.

Nemuno Sakata just wants to get vegetables for soup, but there's trouble on the mountain. Jump and slash your way around a twisting level with enemies throughout and a mystery boss at the end.

This is a fan work of the Touhou Project and is not associated with the original creators.
