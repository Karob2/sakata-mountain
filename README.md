# Sakata Mountain

Game project for Touhou Game Jam 2, using PixiJS.

Nemuno Sakata just wants to get vegetables for soup, but there's trouble on the mountain. Jump and slash your way around a twisting level with enemies throughout and a mystery boss at the end.

This is a fan work of the Touhou Project and is not associated with the original creators.

# Development Instructions

This project is a mass of spaghetti code and bad algorithms thrown together for a 72 hour gamejam. It needs to be largely rewritten.

# Game Instructions

The gimmick of this game is that any enemy can be defeated from a single attack. The challenge is in getting close enough to land the attack without taking too much damage.

- Touch checkpoints to recover health and update your respawn location.
- Avoid bullets.
- Green projectiles can be destroyed with your knife attack (action key).
- Purple enemies float around their "hearts". Attack the heart to destroy the enemy.
- Each heart you collect increases your score. Try to get them all!
- The screen shows health (top-left), score (top-right), and time elapsed in seconds (bottom-left).

*Presently the only way to restart the game is to refresh the page.*

## Controls

- **Move left:** Left Arrow or A
